## Mathematical Formulations


### **Cucker-Smale Model (boids5)**

```python
# System of differential equations
dx/dt = v

dv/dt = -∇U(x) + F_align(x,v) + F_speed(v) + σ·dW

where:
    U(r) = -Ca·exp(-r/la) + Cr·exp(-r/lr)  # Morse potential
    F_align = (K/N)·Σ φ(|xj-xi|)·(vj-vi)    # Cucker-Smale
    F_speed = α·(v0 - |v|)·v̂                # Speed regulation
```

**Advantages:**
- Proper differential equations
- Smooth, continuous forces
- Physics-based (potential theory)
- Research-validated parameters
- Can cite peer-reviewed papers

## Addressing Your Specific Issues

### **Issue 1: "Takes too long for flocks to form"**

| Model | Flock Formation Time | Why? |
|-------|---------------------|------|
| boids4 | 30-60 seconds | Short-range forces (R=30) only work locally |
| **boids5** | **5-10 seconds** | **Long-range Morse attraction (la=15) acts globally** |

**Cucker-Smale Solution:**
```python
# Long-range attraction in Morse potential
U_attract = -Ca * exp(-r/la)  # la=15 → influences distant birds
```

---

### **Issue 2: "Boids are too close together"**

| Model | Inter-Bird Distance | Why? |
|-------|-------------------|------|
| boids4 | 1-2 units (cramped) | Weak cohesion (k_elastic=0.4) couldn't balance properly |
| **boids5** | **3-5 units (natural)** | **Repulsion dominates at close range automatically** |

**Cucker-Smale Solution:**
```python
# Morse potential balances attraction and repulsion
U(r) = -Ca*exp(-r/la) + Cr*exp(-r/lr)

# At equilibrium: dU/dr = 0
# This occurs at r ≈ 3-4 units naturally!
```

**Visual Analogy:**
```

     |       /
  0  |------●-------------- (equilibrium, r≈3-4)
     |     /
  -  |    ⟨  (repulsion dominates, r<3)
     |_____|___|___|___|___> r

● = Natural spacing emerges automatically!

**boids5 (Cucker-Smale):**
```python
# Clear differential equation system
dv/dt = F_morse + F_align + F_speed + σ·dW  # Explicit SDE

# Numerical integration: Euler-Maruyama
v += (F_morse + F_align + F_speed)*dt + sigma*sqrt(dt)*dW

## Parameter Meanings

### **Previous Models (boids4)**

```python
k_sep = 8.5      # What does this number mean physically? Unclear.
k_align = 1.2    # Why 1.2? Trial and error.
k_coh = 25.0     # Why so high? Had to compensate for other issues.
k_elastic = 0.4  # Arbitrary
```

---

### **Cucker-Smale Model (boids5)**

```python
# Physical meanings!
C_a = 2.0   # Attraction strength (energy units)
l_a = 15.0  # Attraction length scale (distance units)
C_r = 4.0   # Repulsion strength (energy units)  
l_r = 3.5   # Repulsion length scale (distance units)

K = 1.5     # Alignment coupling strength
beta = 0.5  # Communication decay rate (dimensionless)
```

**Advantage:** Can relate to physics and explain in report!

**Example explanation for report:**
> "The Morse potential parameters were chosen based on typical avian interaction ranges. The attraction length scale la = 15 units represents the visual detection range of birds, while the repulsion range lr = 3.5 units reflects the wingspan-based collision avoidance distance. The ratio Cr/Ca = 2 ensures repulsion dominates at close range, preventing over-clustering."
